00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.200
Tired of being what you want me to be

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.560
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.140
Don't know what you're expecting of me

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.820
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.940
Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.340
CHORUS:
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.440
CHORUS: 
Become so tired, so much more aware

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.680
CHORUS:
By becoming this all I want to do

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.140
CHORUS:
Is be more like me and be less like you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.540
Can't you see that you're smothering me?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.700
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.980
'Cause everything that you thought I would be

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.880
Has fallen apart, right in front of you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.200
Every step that I take is another mistake
to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.480
And every second I waste is more than I can
take!

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.200
CHORUS:
I've become so numb

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.660
CHORUS:
I can't feel you there

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.720
CHORUS:
Become so tired, so much more aware

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.900
CHORUS: 
By becoming this all I want to do

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.920
CHORUS: 
Is be more like me and be less like you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.520
And I know

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.540
I may end up failing too

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.520
But I know

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.600
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.200
CHORUS:
I've become so numb

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.840
CHORUS: 
I can't feel you there

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.700
CHORUS: 
Become so tired, so much more aware

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.120
CHORUS: 
By becoming this all I want to do

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.220
CHORUS: 
Is be more like me and be less like you

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.380
CHORUS:
I've become so numb

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.080
CHORUS:
I can't feel you there

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.560
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.560
CHORUS: 
I've become so numb

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.580
I can't feel you there

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.920
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
