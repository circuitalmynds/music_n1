LETRA:
It's been at least another year
And still I haven't got the chance to say
Always rolling off the tongue
Never said but nearly sung about a million ways
Every photograph and story
Trickled through the lengthy web of friend
I over thought but understood
Distant look but looking good
And not the other way
But you fail to remember
But you fail to remember
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
With heat struck afternoons long through
Those idle dreams go back to you
The echo's seem somewhat displaced
Ever further from your face, I'm drifting off to
Bored of mere flirtations
That's what's made of constellations that I've sought
Was this only in my head
Just like most things go misread
When overthought
But you fail to remember
But you fail to remember
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
Do I still cross your mind?
Your face still distorts the time
