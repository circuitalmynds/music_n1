From the 1946 musical 'Till the Clouds Roll By,' a fictionalised biography of Jerome Kern, comes the finale. It features a medley of songs by one of America's greatest song writers: 'Yesterdays' with the MGM Studio Chorus; 'Long Ago and Far Away' with Kathryn Grayson; 'A Fine Romance' with Virginia O'Brien; 'All the Things You Are' with Tony Martin; 'Why Was I Born' with Lena Horne; and a grand closing number in a typically astonishing MGM set that features 'Ol' Man River' superbly sung by Frank Sinatra. (VCR vid quality not too good but hopefully it will suffice!)
